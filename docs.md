## Sample Text File to Test Adding Files


This line added for conflict testing. But, Master says, do not conflict with the precious!

Christmas a humbug, Uncle? You don't mean that!

I do. Why what is Christmas but a time for buying things without money, for making merry instead of useful time working? Why if I had my way, every idiot who goes about with Merry Christmas on his lips would be boiled in his own pudding... and buried with a stake of holly through his heart!

Uncle!

Nephew! Let me keep Christmas in my own way.

But you DON'T keep it.

Let me leave it alone then. Much good it has done you. Bah! Much good may it EVER do you!

There are many things by which I have not profited that have done me good, I daresay Christmas among them. And though it has not put a scrap of gold or piece of silver into my pocket, I say, God bless it!

Bah! Humbug!

Come, Uncle! Don't be cross... dine with us tomorrow!

I'll see you... I'll see you in Hell first!

By why, Uncle, why?

Why?

Why did you marry against my wishes?

Why did I marry!? Because I fell in love!

'Because I fell in love...!" There's another... If there's anything more ridiculous thatn 'Merry Christmas,' it's falling in love.  Good day, Nephew!
